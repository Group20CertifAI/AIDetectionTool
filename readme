Executive Summary
In the modern digital age, we are often faced with the challenge of differentiating authentic human-generated content from that created by artificial intelligence. AI has evolved significantly, enabling the creation of realistic text, images, and videos, making it difficult to discern between human and AI creations. This is where our AI detection tool, CertifAI, comes into play.
There are numerous AI detection tools, but they share a common issue - being technologically abundant but accuracy scarce. This implies that despite their sophisticated technologies, if they can't accurately and consistently identify AI-generated content, their utility is limited. The challenge becomes not just detecting AI creations, but accurately identifying them in a diverse array of formats including text, images, and videos. Every individual's interaction with digital content is unique; a robust solution for one person may not work as effectively for another. There is a need for an AI detection tool that takes into account these differences, while simultaneously offering robust, cross-format detection. CertifAI is designed with this very objective in mind.
CertifAI, named for its core mission of providing "certified AI" detection, was developed with the ambition to become a precise tool for users across the globe. It offers differentiated results that are calibrated to individual needs, uses advanced learning algorithms to continuously improve its detection capabilities, and maintains a dynamic database that evolves with emerging AI trends.
CertifAI recognizes the diversity of AI-generated content, distinguishing between text, images, and video. It allows users to understand the authenticity of the content they encounter. By understanding what AI models are commonly used, the tool can differentiate between human and AI-generated content more accurately. Users can also contribute to the database, ensuring that it remains comprehensive and up-to-date, reflecting the dynamic and ever-changing nature of AI-generated content.
With the help of CertifAI, users can plan their interactions with digital content, using our advanced detection capabilities to verify authenticity before engagement. The tool reduces the time spent questioning the authenticity of content by logically storing data and returning results swiftly, while still providing the most accurate detection based on each individual user’s needs.
In conclusion, CertifAI is a tool that guarantees precision, speed, and convenience in detecting AI-generated content. It is designed to ensure that our interactions with the digital world are genuine and trustworthy. CertifAI - an AI detection tool that’s an internet user's wish come true.

Use Cases
Use Case - Detection
The user will upload a text, image, or video file to the AI detection tool. The tool will analyze the file and determine if it was generated by AI. The tool will provide a confidence score to indicate the likelihood of the file being AI-generated.
Description: This use case describes the process of how the user will utilize the detection feature of the AI detection tool.
Actors: 2.1 User 2.2 System
Preconditions: 3.1 User has an active internet connection 3.2 System is available
Primary Flow of Events:
User uploads a text, image, or video file.
System analyzes the file.
System determines if the file was generated by AI.
System provides a confidence score to indicate the likelihood of the file being AI-generated.
Terminate Use Case: Detection
Alternate Flows 5.1 User Uploads Unsupported File Type If in step 1, user uploads a file type that is not supported by the system.
System notifies the user that the file type is not supported.
Return to step 1.
5.2 System is Unable to Determine if File is AI-Generated If in step 3, the system is unable to determine if the file was generated by AI.
System notifies the user that it was unable to make a determination.
Terminate Use Case: Detection
Use Case - Analysis
The user will upload a text, image, or video file to the AI detection tool. The tool will analyze the file and provide detailed analysis on the AI-generated aspects of the file.
Description: This use case describes the process of how the user will utilize the analysis feature of the AI detection tool.
Actors: 2.1 User 2.2 System
Preconditions: 3.1 User has an active internet connection 3.2 System is available
Primary Flow of Events:

System analyzes the file.
System provides detailed analysis on the AI-generated aspects of the file.
Terminate Use Case: Analysis
Alternate Flows 5.1 User Uploads Unsupported File Type If in step 1, user uploads a file type that is not supported by the system.
System notifies the user that the file type is not supported.
Return to step 1.
5.2 System is Unable to Provide Detailed Analysis If in step 3, the system is unable to provide detailed analysis on the AI-generated aspects of the file.
System notifies the user that it was unable to provide detailed analysis.
